# Raft Generic Implementation for TypeScript

This is a straight port from graft (git@github.com:nats-io/graft.git) to TypeScript.

You can ```npm install --save raft.ts``` to add it to your project or you can test it out on your machine by first cloning this repo, running ```npm install```, installing a passwordless nats-server (simply via brew or apt or yum) and running ```npm run dev``` in 3 terminal windows.

Have fun!

P.S.: This was just ported and not enough testing was performed on it (less than 1 hour). If you encounter any issues please let me know the usual way via GitHub's Issues ;-)
